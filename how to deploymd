# How to Deploy Your Website

To deploy your website so you can share it with your friends, you have several options. Here are a few popular and straightforward methods:

## 1. GitHub Pages
GitHub Pages is a free service provided by GitHub that allows you to host static websites directly from a GitHub repository.

### Steps:
1. **Create a GitHub Repository:**
   - Go to GitHub and create a new repository.
   - Name your repository (e.g., `my-website`).

2. **Push Your Code to GitHub:**
   - Initialize a local Git repository in your project folder if you haven't already:
     ```sh
     git init
     ```
   - Add your files to the repository:
     ```sh
     git add .
     ```
   - Commit your changes:
     ```sh
     git commit -m "Initial commit"
     ```
   - Add the remote repository URL:
     ```sh
     git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/my-website.git
     ```
   - Push your code to GitHub:
     ```sh
     git push -u origin main
     ```

3. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub.
   - Click on **Settings**.
   - Scroll down to the **Pages** section.
   - Under **Source**, select the branch you want to deploy (e.g., `main`).
   - Click **Save**.

4. **Access Your Website:**
   - Your website will be available at `https://your-username.github.io/my-website/`.

## 2. Netlify
Netlify is a popular platform for deploying static websites. It offers a free tier with generous limits.

### Steps:
1. **Sign Up for Netlify:**
   - Go to Netlify and sign up for an account.

2. **Deploy Your Site:**
   - Click on **New site from Git**.
   - Connect your GitHub account and select the repository you want to deploy.
   - Follow the prompts to configure the build settings (for a static site, the default settings should work).
   - Click **Deploy site**.

3. **Access Your Website:**
   - Netlify will provide you with a URL where your site is hosted (e.g., `https://your-site-name.netlify.app`).

## 3. Vercel
Vercel is another popular platform for deploying static websites and serverless functions. It also offers a free tier.

### Steps:
1. **Sign Up for Vercel:**
   - Go to Vercel and sign up for an account.

2. **Deploy Your Site:**
   - Click on **New Project**.
   - Connect your GitHub account and select the repository you want to deploy.
   - Follow the prompts to configure the build settings (for a static site, the default settings should work).
   - Click **Deploy**.

3. **Access Your Website:**
   - Vercel will provide you with a URL where your site is hosted (e.g., `https://your-site-name.vercel.app`).

## 4. Local Server with Ngrok
If you want to share your local development server temporarily, you can use Ngrok.

### Steps:
1. **Install Ngrok:**
   - Download and install Ngrok from [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com).

2. **Run Your Local Server:**
   - Start your local development server (e.g., using `http-server` or any other local server).

3. **Expose Your Local Server:**
   - Run Ngrok to expose your local server:
     ```sh
     ngrok http 8080
     ```
   - Replace `8080` with the port your local server is running on.

4. **Share the URL:**
   - Ngrok will provide you with a public URL (e.g., `https://abcd1234.ngrok.io`) that you can share with your friends.

Choose the method that best suits your needs. For a more permanent solution, GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel are recommended.
